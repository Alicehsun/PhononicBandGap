It is made a silicon square with a circle hole inside full of air. 

Air
Radious of the hole R = 2mm, E2 = 1.42*10^5 Pa, Poisson2 = 1.4 (calculated as C_p/C_v = i+2/2),
density Rho2 = 1.2 kg/m^3

Silicon
Length L1=7mm, E1 = 156*10^9 Pa, Poisson1 = 0.27, density Rho1 = 2329 kg/m^3

In physics of solid mechanics it is used Floquet Periodic Conditions.
     for left and right borders: kx = if(k<1,pi/a*k,if(k<2,0,(3-k)*pi/a))
     for top and bottom borders: ky = if(k<1,0,if(k<2,pi/a*(k-1),(3-k)*pi/a))
     
where a = 0.543 nm - length of crystal lattice for silicon;
k is a parameter for wave number, range is from 0 to 3.
k=0-1 - wave propogates in horizontal direcion
k=1-2 - vertical direction
k=2-3 - diagonal direction
-pi/a < kx < pi/a - first Brillouin zone.

For getting rid of creating waves inside of a circle it is used Prescribed Displacement. 

For such hole the frequencies that don't propogate are about 1.32 MHz (horizontal and vertical directions).
The error occurs for diagonal direcion of wave number vector. 

To make sure that this band gap is determined by the size of the hole, the silicon square was increased to L2=9mm.
The frequencies of the band gap are stayed the same.

Due to the formula f = v/b, 
where v is a velocity of sound in material, b is a diameter of a hole
for f = 1.32*10^6 Hz and b = 4*10^-3 m, v = 5280 m/s.

Due to the source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeds_of_sound_of_the_elements_(data_page) 
where transversal speed of sound in silicon is 5843 m/s,
the calculation seems to be correct.

For b = 5*10^-3 m, f must to be about 1 MHz.
The calculation gives the same result.
