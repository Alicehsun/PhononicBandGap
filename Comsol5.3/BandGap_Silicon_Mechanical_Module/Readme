It is made a silicon square with a circle hole inside full of air. 

Air
Radious of the hole R = 2mm, E2 = 1.42*10^5 Pa, Poisson2 = 1.4 (calculated as C_p/C_v = i+2/2),
density Rho2 = 1.2 kg/m^3

Silicon
Length L1=7mm, E1 = 156*10^9 Pa, Poisson1 = 0.27, density Rho1 = 2329 kg/m^3

In physics of solid mechanics it is used Floquet Periodic Conditions.
     for left and right borders: kx = if(k<1,pi/a*k,if(k<2,0,(3-k)*pi/a))
     for top and bottom borders: ky = if(k<1,0,if(k<2,pi/a*(k-1),(3-k)*pi/a))
     
where a = 0.543 nm - length of crystal lattice for silicon;
k is a parameter for wave number, range is from 0 to 3.
k=0-1 - wave propogates in horizontal direcion
k=1-2 - vertical direction
k=2-3 - diagonal direction
-pi/a < kx < pi/a - first Brillouin zone.

For getting rid of creating waves inside of a circle it is used Prescribed Displacement. 

For such size of a square and a hole the frequencies that don't propogate are about 1.32 MHz (horizontal and vertical directions).
The error occurs for diagonal direcion of wave number vector. 
The result is calculated for 5 desired number of eigenfrequencies.
For 6 number the result differes due to the error in calculations (mesh doesn't change the picture).
8 number of eigenfrequencies gives the same result as for 5.

Assuming that the bandgap is created by the hole in the bulk, the silicon square was increased to L2=9mm.
The bandgap for frequencies about 1.32 MHz is created for 7 desired number of eigenfrequencies and matches with previous calculation. 
However, for 5 number it gives mess.

Due to the formula f = v/b, 
where v is a velocity of sound in material, b is a diameter of a hole
for f = 1.32*10^6 Hz and b = 4*10^-3 m, v = 5280 m/s.

Due to the source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeds_of_sound_of_the_elements_(data_page) 
the transversal speed of sound in silicon is 5843 m/s.

For b = 5*10^-3 m, f must to be about 1 MHz.
The calculation gives such result for 5, 6, 7 desired number of eigenfrequencies. 
There is no deviation for this radius of the hole with the size of square L2=7mm. 

Conclusion: Solid Mechanics Module is not appropriate module for accurate calculation of Phononic BandGap
as the result in some cases diverges due to the choice of number eigenfrequencies. 
3D model gives also this dependance.
