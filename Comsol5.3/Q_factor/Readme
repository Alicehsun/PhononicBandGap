The model for the 3 inches (76.2 mm) silicon wafer with holes 3.77 mm in diameter. 
Silicon properties: Young's modulus 156e9 Pa, Poisson's ratio 0.27, density 2329 kg/m^3.
Damping of silicon: 10^(-8).
Calculated frequencies: 595Hz, 1278Hz, 1MHz. 
The Q-factor is determined by the damping in silicon and it doesn't diverge from the Q'factor of the wafer without holes.
The model in Solid Mechanics physics and Eigenfrequency study doesn't work for such calculations.
