The example from Comsol that presents the periodic unit cell with Floquet boundary conditions. It is shown the first Brillouin zone. 
The calculation is made as a parametric sweep involving one parameter k, which varies from 0 to 3. 
 Here, 0 to 1 defines a wave number spanning the Γ-X edge (horizontal), 1 to 2 defines a wave number spanning the X-M edge (vertical), 
 and 2 to 3 defines a wave number spanning the diagonal M-Γ edge. The projection of k vector is written using formulas:
 kx = if(k<1,pi/L1*k,if(k<2,pi/L1,(3-k)*pi/L1));
 ky = if(k<1,0,if(k<2,(k-1)*pi/L1,(3-k)*pi/L1)), whre L1 is the size of the cell and k is taken as 0.5.
It plots the graphic where the wave propagation frequencies depend on the value of k.
